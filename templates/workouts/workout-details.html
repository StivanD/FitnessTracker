                    <h5>Workout Breakdown</h5>
                    <p>This workout is divided into three main phases: Warm-up, Strength Exercises, and Cool-down.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Warm-up (5 minutes)</strong> - Light cardio and dynamic stretches to prepare your
                            body for the workout.

                            the major muscle groups. Focus on form and controlled movements.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Cool-down (5 minutes)</strong> - Static stretches to reduce muscle tightness and
                            improve flexibility.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Detailed Exercise List</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Squats</strong> - 3 sets of 12 reps. Strengthen the legs, glutes, and core.</li>
                        <li><strong>Push-ups</strong> - 3 sets of 10 reps. Target the chest, shoulders, and triceps.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Plank</strong> - 3 sets of 30 seconds. Engage the core, shoulders, and glutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dumbbell Rows</strong> - 3 sets of 12 reps. Focus on the back and biceps.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Instructor Tips</h5>
                    <p><strong>Form is Key:</strong> Make sure to keep your back straight during squats and rows. A
                        slight bend in your knees during push-ups will reduce strain on your shoulders.</p>
                    <p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Avoid arching your back during planks or letting your knees
                        cave in during squats.</p>

                    <h5>Benefits of This Workout</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Increased Strength:</strong> Build muscle and strength, especially in the lower body
                            and upper body.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Improved Posture:</strong> Targeting the core and back muscles helps improve your
                            posture.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Boosted Confidence:</strong> As you see progress, your strength and confidence will
                            grow.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>What to Expect</h5>
                    <p>After completing this workout, you should feel a sense of accomplishment, a bit of muscle
                        soreness (especially if you're new to strength training), and a boost in overall energy
                        levels.</p>
